## Project Overview

This project provides a lightweight web interface that extracts text from two uploaded PDF files using [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/) and then generates a visual diff using Python's built-in [difflib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html). The design emphasizes ease of use with a minimalistic interface, allowing you to effortlessly compare PDF document versions.
